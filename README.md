# Background
Lung cancer remains a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection through image segmentation can greatly assist in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project employs the UNIT architecture, known for its ability to generate high-quality segmentations from medical imaging data.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises CT scan images of lung cancer patients. Due to privacy and ethical considerations, the dataset used cannot be hosted directly in this repository. However, instructions on accessing and preprocessing the data are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

# Methodology
The lung cancer segmentation model is built using the UNIT architecture, incorporating deep learning techniques. The detailed methodology and code implementation can be found in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

# Usage
To replicate or experiment with this project:

# Clone this repository.
Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook (file.ipynb) to set up the environment and preprocess the data.
Execute the code cells in the notebook to train the model or perform inference.
Results
The model's performance metrics and visualized segmentation outputs are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook. Evaluation metrics such as Dice coefficient or Intersection over Union (IoU) may be included to assess the segmentation accuracy.
